# Flexi Apps

This repository serves as a collection of boilerplate code for various stack combinations that are frequently used in my projects. The primary goal of the Flexi Apps project is to streamline the process of setting up new applications, serve as a quick reference when developing other applications, and showcase my portfolio.

## Introduction

Developing full-stack applications often involves assembling a combination of back-end and front-end technologies. Flexi Apps provides a range of pre-configured setups that can be quickly used as starting points for my (and also yours) projects. These stacks are flexible and interchangeable, allowing them to match most application's requirements.

Each Flexi app includes a Docker-based development and production environment and a README with detailed instructions on setting up and running the application.

## Apps Naming

The Flexi apps are named after their role in a stack (or by being the stack itself) and the language used. Some examples of names are:
- `flexi-frontend-react`
- `flexi-backend-clojure`
- `flexi-stack-clojure-react`

## Usage

Feel free to use the Flexi Apps repository as a starting point for your own projects or as a reference when creating new applications. Each app's README contains detailed information about its specific stack and how to run it.

Since this project is meant to be a portfolio of my work and knowledge, pull requests will not be allowed. However, opening issues is welcome, and I'll try to fix any problem or improve existing code when possible.
